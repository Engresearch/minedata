# minedata
/n data acquisition
Create a data ingestion pipeline for mining environmental data. This pipeline uses Python with pandas for data handling and SQLite for storage.
required packages:
Pandas
Numpy
Python-dateutil
Sqlalchemy
pyserial

The data ingestion pipeline does the following: 
Creates a SQLite database to store sensor readings
Simulates sensor data collection (replace with real sensor integration)
Stores readings with timestamps and location IDs
Provides methods to retrieve historical data
Includes a demo that collects data from multiple locations

Preprocessing
I have updated the MineDataCollector class, allowing the code to work on Raspberry Pi 4 with actual sensors while maintaining compatibility with the simulation mode for testing. I connect sensors to the appropriate I2C pins on the Raspberry Pi and adjust the I2C addresses based on specific sensor configurations.
Required packages:
smbus2
adafruit-circuitpython-bmp280

These preprocessing changes:
Add support for I2C sensor communication using smbus2
Include temperature sensor support via Adafruit BMP280
Maintain simulation capability as fallback
Add graceful error handling for sensor failures
Keep the existing database structure

anomaly detection
Create an alarm and anomaly detection system that will now monitor sensor readings in real-time and trigger alerts when thresholds are exceeded or anomalies are detected.
Required packages:
scikit-learn
RPi.GPIO

This block of code:
Implements threshold-based monitoring
Adds LED and buzzer alerts using GPIO
Implements anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
Trains the model on historical data
Triggers alarms for both threshold violations and anomalies

Make sure to connect:
LED to GPIO18 and ground
Buzzer to GPIO23 and ground


Predictive modeling
Developed a time-series forecasting model using Meta's Llama to predict future gas concentrations, temperature, humidity, and particulate matter levels in underground mines. 
required packages:
torch
transformers
scikit-learn

This code bloc::
Creates a forecasting model using Llama-2
Prepares time series data in sequences
Trains the model on historical data
Makes predictions for future values
Evaluates performance using MAE, RMSE, and R²
The model uses a sequence of 24 previous readings to predict the next values. 


Emergency response
Created an emergency response module called emergency_response.py that integrates anomaly detection and predictive models.
This code block:
Creates an EmergencyResponse class that manages ventilation, alerts, and evacuation
Integrates with GPIO for physical control systems
Sends email alerts to emergency contacts
Assesses sensor data, predictions, and anomalies to trigger appropriate responses
Manages evacuation procedures with monitoring capabilities


Visualization
Created a web dashboard using Flask to visualize the mine monitoring data.
Required packages
flask
flask-login
plotly

This code block creates:

A Flask app with user authentication
Real-time sensor data visualization using Plotly
Interactive charts that update every 30 seconds
A simple login system (username: admin, password: admin)
A responsive grid layout for the charts


Integration
Integrate all modules (data acquisition, preprocessing, anomaly detection, predictive modeling, emergency response, and visualization) into a cohesive system by creating a new system_manager.py file that orchestrates all components.
The system manager:
Integrates all modules into a single coherent system
Runs data collection in a background thread
Trains models with historical data
Continuously monitors sensor data, detects anomalies, and predicts future values
Triggers emergency responses when needed
Provides real-time visualization through the dashboard
